# High-Level Design
![High-Level Design]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/engines_high_level_design.png){: class="thumbnail center-block img-responsive" }

On the diagram above is shown interaction of major components of JerryScript: Parser and Virtual Machine (VM). Parser performs translation of input ECMAScript application into the byte-code with the specified format (refer to [Bytecode](#byte-code) and [Parser](#parser) page for details). Prepared bytecode is executed by the Virtual Machine that performs interpretation (refer to [Virtual Machine](#virtual-machine) and [ECMA](#ecma) pages for details).

# Parser

The parser is implemented as a recursive descent parser. The parser converts the JavaScript source code directly into byte-code without building an Abstract Syntax Tree. The parser depends on the following subcomponents.

## Lexer

The lexer splits input string (ECMAScript program) into sequence of tokens. It is able to scan the input string not only forward, but it is possible to move to an arbitrary position. The token structure described by structure `lexer_token_t` in `./jerry-core/parser/js/js-lexer.h`.

## Scanner

Scanner (`./jerry-core/parser/js/js-parser-scanner.h`) pre-scans the input string to find certain tokens. For example, scanner determines whether the keyword `for` defines a general for or a for-in loop. Reading tokens in a while loop is not enough because a slash (`/`) can indicate the start of a regular expression or can be a division operator.

## Expression Parser

Expression parser is responsible for parsing JavaScript expressions. It is implemented in `./jerry-core/parser/js/js-parser-expr.c`.

## Statement Parser

JavaScript statements are parsed by this component. It uses the [Expression parser](#expression parser) to parse the constituent expressions. The implementation of Statement parser is located in `./jerry-core/parser/js/js-parser-statm.c`.

Function `parser_parse_source` carries out the parsing and compiling of the input EcmaScript source code. When a function appears in the source `parser_parse_source` calls `parser_parse_function` which is responsible for processing the source code of functions recursively including argument parsing and context handling. After the parsing, function `parser_post_processing` dumps the created opcodes and returns an ecma_compiled_code_t* that points to the compiled bytecode sequence.

The interactions between the major components shown on the following figure.

# Byte-code

This section describes the compact byte-code (CBC) byte-code representation. The key focus is reducing memory consumption of the byte-code representation without sacrificing considerable performance. Other byte-code representations often focus on performance only so inventing this representation is an original research.

CBC is a CISC like instruction set which assigns shorter instructions for frequent operations. Many instructions represent multiple atomic tasks which reduces the byte code size. This technique is basically a data compression method.

## Compiled code format

The memory layout of the compiled byte code is the following.

![CBC layout]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/CBC_layout.png){: class="thumbnail center-block img-responsive" }

The header is a `cbc_compiled_code` structure with several fields. These fields contain the key properties of the compiled code.

The literals part is an array of ecma values. These values can contain any EcmaScript value types, e.g. strings, numbers, function and regexp templates. The number of literals is stored in the `literal_end` field of the header.

CBC instruction list is a sequence of byte code instructions which represents the compiled code.

## Byte-code Format

The memory layout of a byte-code is the following:

![byte-code layout]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/opcode_layout.png){: class="thumbnail center-block img-responsive" }

Each byte-code starts with an opcode. The opcode is one byte long for frequent and two byte long for rare instructions. The first byte of the rare instructions is always zero (`CBC_EXT_OPCODE`), and the second byte represents the extended opcode. The name of common and rare instructions start with `CBC_` and `CBC_EXT_` prefix respectively.

The maximum number of opcodes is 511, since 255 common (zero value excluded) and 256 rare instructions can be defined. Currently around 230 frequent and 120 rare instructions are available.

There are three types of bytecode arguments in CBC:

 * __byte argument__: A value between 0 and 255, which often represents the argument count of call like opcodes (function call, new, eval, etc.).

 * __literal argument__: An integer index which is greater or equal than zero and less than the `literal_end` field of the header. For further information see next section Literals (next). 

 * __relative branch__: An 1-3 byte long offset. The branch argument might also represent the end of an instruction range. For example the branch argument of `CBC_EXT_WITH_CREATE_CONTEXT` shows the end of a with statement. More precisely the position after the last instruction.

Argument combinations are limited to the following seven forms:

* no arguments
* a literal argument
* a byte argument
* a branch argument
* a byte and a literal arguments
* two literal arguments
* three literal arguments

## Literals

Literals are organized into groups whose represent various literal types. Having these groups consuming less space than assigning flag bits to each literal.
(In the followings, the mentioned ranges represent those indicies which are greater than or equal to the left side and less than the right side of the range. For example a range between `ident_end` and `literal_end` fields of the byte-code header contains those indicies, which are greater than or equal to `ident_end`
and less than `literal_end`. If `ident_end` equals to `literal_end` the range is empty.)

The two major group of literals are _identifiers_ and _values_.

  * __identifier__: A named reference to a variable. Literals between zero and `ident_end` of the header belongs to here. All of these literals must be a string or undefined. Undefined can only be used for those literals which cannot be accessed by a literal name. For example `function (arg,arg)` has two arguments, but the `arg` identifier only refers to the second argument. In such cases the name of the first argument is undefined. Furthermore optimizations such as *CSE* may also introduce literals without name.

  * __value__: A reference to an immediate value. Literals between `ident_end` and `const_literal_end` are constant values such as numbers or strings. These literals can be used directly by the Virtual Machine. Literals between `const_literal_end` and `literal_end` are template literals. A new object needs to be constructed each time when their value is accessed. These literals are functions and regular expressions.

There are two other sub-groups of identifiers. *Registers* are those identifiers which are stored in the function call stack. *Arguments* are those registers which are passed by a caller function.

There are two types of literal encoding in CBC. Both are variable length, where the length is one or two byte long.

  * __small__: maximum 511 literals can be encoded.
    
One byte encoding for literals 0 - 254.
      
```c
byte[0] = literal_index
```

Two byte encoding for literals 255 - 510.
      
```c
byte[0] = 0xff
byte[1] = literal_index - 0xff
```

  * __full__: maximum 32767 literal can be encoded.
    
One byte encoding for literals 0 - 127.
      
```c
byte[0] = literal_index
```

Two byte encoding for literals 128 - 32767.
      
```c
byte[0] = (literal_index >> 8) | 0x80
byte[1] = (literal_index & 0xff)
```

Since most functions require less than 255 literal, small encoding provides a single byte literal index for all literals. Small encoding consumes less space than full encoding, but it has a limited range.

## Byte-code Categories

Byte-codes can be placed into four main categories.

### Push Byte-codes

Byte-codes of this category serve for placing objects onto the stack. As there are many instructions representing multiple atomic tasks in CBC, there are also many instructions for pushing objects onto the stack according to the number and the type of the arguments. The following table list a few of these opcodes with a brief description.

<div class="CSSTableGenerator" markdown="block">

| byte-code                            | description                                       |
| CBC_PUSH_LITERAL                     | Pushes the value of the given literal argument.     |
| CBC_PUSH_TWO_LITERALS                | Pushes the value of the given two literal arguments. |
| CBC_PUSH_UNDEFINED                   | Pushes an undefined value.                          |
| CBC_PUSH_TRUE                        | Pushes a logical true.                              |
| CBC_PUSH_PROP_LITERAL                | Pushes a property whose base object is popped from the stack, and the property name is passed as a literal argument. |

</div>

### Call Byte-codes

The byte-codes of this category perform calls in different ways.

<div class="CSSTableGenerator" markdown="block">

| byte-code                            | description |
| CBC_CALL0                            | Calls a function without arguments. The return value won't be pushed onto the stack. |
| CBC_CALL1                            | Calls a function with one argument. The return value won't be pushed onto the stack. |
| CBC_CALL                             | Calls a function with n arguments. n is passed as a byte argument. The return value won't be pushed onto the stack. |
| CBC_CALL0_PUSH_RESULT                | Calls a function without arguments. The return value will be pushed onto the stack. |
| CBC_CALL1_PUSH_RESULT                | Calls a function with one argument. The return value will be pushed onto the stack. |
| CBC_CALL2_PROP                       | Calls a property function with two arguments. The base object, the property name, and the two arguments are on the stack. |

</div>

### Arithmetic, Logical, Bitwise and Assignment Byte-codes

The opcodes of this category perform arithmetic, logical, bitwise and assignment operations according to the different 

<div class="CSSTableGenerator" markdown="block">

| byte-code                            | description |
| CBC_LOGICAL_NOT                      | Negates the logical value that popped from the stack. The result is pushed onto the stack. |
| CBC_LOGICAL_NOT_LITERAL              | Negates the logical value that given in literal argument. The result is pushed onto the stack. |
| CBC_ADD                              | Adds two values that are poped from the stack. The result is pushed onto the stack.  |
| CBC_ADD_RIGHT_LITERAL                | Adds two values. The left one popped from the stack, the right one is given as literal argument. |
| CBC_ADD_TWO_LITERALS                 | Adds two values. Both are given as literal arguments. |
| CBC_ASSIGN                           | Assigns a value to a property. It has three arguments: base object, property name, value to assign. |
| CBC_ASSIGN_PUSH_RESULT               | Assigns a value to a property. It has three arguments: base object, property name, value to assign. The result will be pushed onto the stack. |

</div>

### Branch Byte-codes

Branch byte-codes are used to perform conditional and unconditional jumps in the byte-code. The arguments of these instructions are 1-3 byte long relative offsets. The number of bytes is part of the opcode, so each byte-code with a branch argument has three forms. The direction (forward, backward) is also defined by the opcode since the offset is an unsigned value. Thus, certain branch instructions has six forms. Some examples can be found in the following table.

<div class="CSSTableGenerator" markdown="block">

| byte-code                            | description |
| CBC_JUMP_FORWARD                     | Jumps forward by the 1 byte long relative offset argument. |
| CBC_JUMP_FORWARD_2                   | Jumps forward by the 2 byte long relative offset argument. |
| CBC_JUMP_FORWARD_3                   | Jumps forward by the 3 byte long relative offset argument. |
| CBC_JUMP_BACKWARD                    | Jumps backward by the 1 byte long relative offset argument. |
| CBC_JUMP_BACKWARD_2                  | Jumps backward by the 2 byte long relative offset argument. |
| CBC_JUMP_BACKWARD_3                  | Jumps backward by the 3 byte long relative offset argument. |
| CBC_BRANCH_IF_TRUE_FORWARD           | Jumps if the value on the top of the stack is true by the 1 byte long relative offset argument. |

</div>

# Virtual Machine

Virtual machine is an interpreter which executes byte-code instructions one by one. The function that starts the interpretation is `vm_run` in `./jerry-core/vm/vm.c`. `vm_loop` is the main loop of the virtual machine, which has the peculiarity that it is *non-recursive*. This means that in case of function calls it does not calls itself recursively but returns, which has the benefit that it does not burdens the stack as a recursive implementation.


# ECMA

ECMA component of the engine is responsible for the following notions:

* Data representation
* Runtime representation
* Garbage collection (gc)

## Data representation

The major structure for data representation is `ECMA_value`. The lower two bits of this structure encode value tag, which determines the type of the value:

* simple
* number
* string
* object

![ECMA value representation]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/ecma_value.png){: class="thumbnail center-block img-responsive" }

In case of number, string and object the value contains an encoded pointer.
Simple value is a pre-defined constant which can be:

* undefined
* null
* true
* false
* empty (uninitialized value)

For other value types the higher bits of `ECMA_value` structure contains compressed pointer to the real value.

### Compressed pointers

Compressed pointers were introduced to save heap space.
![Compressed Pointer]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/ecma_compressed.png){: class="thumbnail center-block img-responsive" }

ECMA data elements are allocated in pools (pools are allocated on heap)
Chunk size of the pool is 8 bytes (reduces fragmentation).

### Number

There are two possible representation of numbers according to standard IEEE 754:

* 4-byte (float, compact profile)
* 8-byte (double, full profile)

![Number]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/number.png){: class="thumbnail center-block img-responsive" }

Several references to single allocated number are not supported. Each reference holds its own copy of a number.

### String

### Object / Lexical environment

Object and lexical environment structures, 8 bytes each, have common (GC) header:
  * Stack refs counter
  * Next object/lexical environment in list of objects/lexical environments
  * GC's visited flag
  * is_lexenv flag

Remaining fields of these structures are different and are shown on the figure below.

![Object/Lexicat environment structures]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/ecma_object.jpg){: class="thumbnail center-block img-responsive" }

### Property of an object / description of a lexical environment variable

While objects comprise of properties, lexical environments consist of variables. Both of these units are tied up into lists. Unit types could be different:
  * named data (property or variable)
  * named accessor (property)
  * internal (implementation defined)

All these units occupy 8 bytes and have common header:
  * type - 2 bit
  * next property/variable in the object/lexical environment (compressed pointer)

The remaining parts are differnt:
![Object property/lexcial environment variable]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/ecma_object_property.jpg){: class="thumbnail center-block img-responsive" }

### Collections

ECMA runtime utilizes collections for intermediate calculations. Collection consists of a header and a number of linked chunks, which hold collection values.

Header occupies 8 bytes and consists of:
 * compressed pointer to the next chunk
 * number of elements
 * rest space, aligned down to byte, is for the first chunk of data in collection

Chunk's layout is following:
 * compressed pointer to the next chunk
 * rest space, aligned down to byte, is for data stored in corresponding part of the collection

### Internal properties:

* [[Class]] - class of the object (ECMA-defined)
* [[Prototipe]] - is stored in object description
* [[Extensible]] - is stored in object description
* [[CScope]] - lexical environment (function's variable space)
* [[ParametersMap]] - arguments object -0 code of the function
* [[Code]] - where to find bytecode of the function
* native code - where to find code of native unction
* native handle - some uintptr_t assosiated with the objec
* [[FormalParameters]] - collection of pointers to ecma_string_t (the list of formal parameters of the function)
* [[PrimitiveValue]] for String - for String object
* [[PrimitiveValue]] for Number - for Number object
* [[PrimitiveValue]] for Boolean - for Boolean object
* built-in related:
  * built-in id - id of built-in object
  * built-in routine id - id of built-in routine
  * "non-instantiated" mask - what built-in properties where notinstantiated yet (lazy instantiation)
  * extention object identifier

### LCache

LCache is a cache for property variable search requests.

![LCache]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/ecma_lcache.png){: class="thumbnail center-block img-responsive"}

The entries of LCache has the following layout:
  * object (pointer to object)
  * property name (pointer to string)
  * property (pointer to property)

The layout above presents multiple times in row. The rows of LCache is indexed by property name hash. When a property access occurs, all row's entries are searched by comparing object pointer and property name according entry's fields, full comparison is used for property name.

If corresponding entry was found, its property pointer is returned (may be NULL - in case when there is no property with specified name in given object).
Otherwise, the property set of the considered object is iterated over and the corresponding record is registered in LCache (with property pointer if it was found or NULL  otherwise).

## Runtime

ECMA-defined runtime operations are implemented mostly with routine having the following signature:

`ecma_completion_value_t ecma_op_* ([ecma_value_t arguments])`  
or  
`ecma_property_t * ecma_op_[find/get]*_property (objs, name string, ...)`  

However, there could be some combinations.

### Completion value

Many algorithms/routines described in ECMA return a value of "completion" type, that is triplet of the following form:

![ECMA completion]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/ecma_completion.jpg){: class="thumbnail center-block img-responsive" }

Jerry introduces two additional completion types:
  * exit - produced by `exitval` opcode, indicates request to finish execution
  * meta - produced by meta instruction, used to catch meta opcodes in interpreter loop without explicit comparison on every iteration (for example: meta 'end_with')

### Value management and ownership

Every value stored by engine is associated with virtual "ownership" (that is responsible for manage the value and free it when is is not needed, or pass ownership of the value to somewhere)

<div class="CSSTableGenerator" markdown="block">

| Value type| "Alloc" op | "Free" op|
| Number| ecma_alloc_number| ecma_dealloc_number|
| String| ecma_copy_or_ref_ecma_string| ecma_deref_ecma_string|
| Object|ecma_ref_object (for on_stack references) on_heap references are managed by GC|ecma_deref_object (for on_stack references) on_heap references are managed by GC|
| Property|(ownership is strongly connected with corresponding object)|(ownership is strongly connected with corresponding object)|
| Simple value|no memory management|no memory management|
| ecma_value (including values contained in completion value)|ecma_copy_value| ecma_free_value|

</div>

Initially, value is allocated by its owner (i.e with ownership).
Value, passed in argument is passed without ownership.
Value, returned from function is returned with ownership.
Rules for completion value are the same as rules for values, contained in them.

## Opcode handler structure

Most opcode handlers consists of the following steps:
1. Decode instruction (i.e. extract `idx`-s)
2. Read input values from variables/registers
3. Perform necessary type conversions
4. Perform calls to runtime
5. Save execution result to output variable
6. Increment opcode position counter
7. Return completion value.

Steps 2-5 can produce exceptions.
In this case execution is continued after corresponding FINALIZE mark, and completion value is set to throw exception.

## Exception handling

Operations that could produce exceptions should be performed in one of the following ways:
  * wrapped into ECMA_TRY_CATCH block:
    * `ECMA_TRY_CATCH (value_returned_from_op, op (... ),`
    * `ret_value_of_the_whole_routine_handler)``
    * `...`
    * `ECMA_FINALIZE(value_returned_from_op);`
    * `return ret_value;`
  * `ret_value = op(...);`
  * manual handling (for special cases like interpretation of opfunc_try_block).
