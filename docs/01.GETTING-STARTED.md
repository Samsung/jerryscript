## Setting up prerequisites

Currently, only Ubuntu 14.04+ is officially supported as primary development environment.

[Vagrant can also be used](#building-jerryscript-with-vagrant) to build JerryScript.

There are several dependencies, that should be installed manually. The following list is the absolute minimum for building:

- `gcc` or any C99-compliant compiler (native or cross, e.g., arm-none-eabi)
- `cmake` >= `2.8.12.2`

Several scripts and tools help the building and development process, thus it is recommended to have the following installed as well:

- `bash` >= `4.3.11`
- `cppcheck` >= `1.61`
- `vera++` >= `1.2.1`
- `python` >= `2.7.6`

```bash
sudo apt-get install gcc gcc-arm-none-eabi cmake cppcheck vera++ python
```

To make our scripts run correctly, several shell utilities should be available on the system:

- `awk`
- `bc`
- `find`
- `sed`

## Building JerryScript

**To build debug version for Linux**

```bash
python tools/build.py --debug
```

**To build debug version for Linux without LTO (Link Time Optimization)**

```bash
python tools/build.py --debug --lto=off
```

**Add custom arguments to CMake**

```bash
python tools/build.py --cmake-param=CMAKE_PARAM
```

**Set a profile mode (ES5.1, subset of ES2015, minimal)**

```bash
python tools/build.py --profile=es5.1|es2015-subset|minimal
```

**Use (jerry, compiler-default, external) libc**

The default libc is jerry-libc, but you can use compiler-default libc or an external libc:

- compiler-default libc:

```bash
python tools/build.py --jerry-libc=off
```

- external libc:

```bash
python tools/build.py --jerry-libc=off --compile-flag="-nostdlib -I/path/to/ext-libc/include" --link-lib="ext-c"
```

**Add toolchain file**

The ```cmake``` dir already contains some usable toolchain files, which you can use in the following format:

```bash
python tools/build.py --toolchain=TOOLCHAIN
```

For example the cross-compile to RaspberryPi 2 is something like this:

```bash
python tools/build.py --toolchain=cmake/toolchain_linux_armv7l.cmake
```

**Use system memory allocator**

```bash
python tools/build.py --system-allocator=on --jerry-libc=off
```

*Note*: System allocator is only supported on 32 bit systems.

**Enable 32bit compressed pointers**

```bash
python tools/build.py --cpointer-32bit=on
```

*Note*: There is no compression/decompression on 32 bit systems, if enabled.

**Change default heap size (512K)**

```bash
python tools/build.py --mem-heap=256
```

If you would like to use more than 512K, then you must enable the 32 bit compressed pointers.

```bash
python tools/build.py --cpointer-32bit=on --mem-heap=1024
```

*Note*: The heap size will be allocated statically at compile time, when JerryScript memory
allocator is used.

**To get a list of all the available buildoptions for Linux**

```bash
python tools/build.py --help
```

## Checking patch

```bash
python tools/run-tests.py --precommit
```

### Running only one type of test

**To run build option tests**

```bash
python tools/run-tests.py --buildoption-test
```

**To run unittests**

```bash
python tools/run-tests.py --unittests
```

**To run jerry-tests**

```bash
python tools/run-tests.py --jerry-tests
```

**To run jerry-test-suite**

```bash
python tools/run-tests.py --jerry-test-suite
```

**To run signed-off check**

```bash
python tools/run-tests.py --check-signed-off
```

**To run cppcheck**

```bash
python tools/run-tests.py --check-cppcheck
```

**To run vera check**

```bash
python tools/run-tests.py --check-vera
```

**To get a list of all the available test options**

```bash
python tools/run-tests.py --help
```

## Building JerryScript with Vagrant

[Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com) provides virtual development environments for popular host operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).  We can use this to build JerryScript.

1.  Follow the [instructions on how to install Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/intro/getting-started/index.html) for your operating system.

    > TL;DR: install Vagrant and [VirtualBox](https://virtualbox.org) using your method of choice.
2.  Execute `vagrant up` in your JerryScript working copy:

    ```bash
    # Windows/PowerShell users will do something similar
    $ cd /path/to/jerryscript
    $ vagrant up
    ```
    
    The above command will:
    
    1.  Download the Ubuntu 14.04 Vagrant box (think of this as an "image")
    2.  Start a headless "guest" OS based on the box via VirtualBox
    3.  Update & upgrade the guest OS' base packages
    4.  Download and install the [prerequisites](#setting-up-the-prerequisites) to build JerryScript on the guest OS
3.  The `jerryscript` directory is shared within the guest OS at `/home/vagrant/jerryscript`.  You can use `vagrant ssh` to open a shell.  You can navigate to this directory, and use any of the [above commands](#building-jerryscript) for development:
  
    ```bash
    you@your-computer:/path/to/jerryscript$ vagrant ssh
    vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ cd ~/jerryscript
    vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/jerryscript$ python tools/build.py
    # (building happens here)
    ```
    
    > PRO TIP: You can execute `vagrant ssh -c 'python ~/jerryscript/tools/build.py'` to run this command directly from your host operating system.
